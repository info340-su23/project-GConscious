        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <!--Eric's Part-->
        <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <p>The question of interest we raised as a group is how can we reinforce the government website's functionality and make it easier for everyone to access with correct information.</p>
        <!--Eric's Part-->
        <h3>2. Information technology problem</h3>
        <p>After doing some research online with our group members, we found out that the capability to search on government websites is limited. The website of the <a href="https://apps.des.wa.gov/DESContracts/" target="_blank">Washington State Department of Enterprise Services</a> from Washington State would be a good example for explanation: some of the information is sorted into the wrong category, some of the information on contract details are incomplete and outdated, and the website could be a challenge for some users to navigate.</p>
        <!--Samaya's Part-->
        <h3>3. What has already been tried</h3>
        <p>There are already multiple official government websites which in theory are meant to fill the niche of connecting small businesses with lucrative government contracts. State governments, as well as the federal government, all have websites like this. However, these websites have almost always failed in practice. They tend to have poor information filtering algorithms, fail to categorize contracts in a useful way, and many of the listings are outdated (presumably due to the poor usability of the existing websites). The previous solution to the problem of government contract accessibility which we will most be basing our improved service off of will be the Washington State Department of Enterprise Services contract search webpage.</p>
        <!-- Mike's Part -->
        <h3>4. Summary</h3>
        <p>Overall, state government websites are notorious for being nearly indecipherable when trying to navigate their contents. As such, navigating through government platforms can prove to be difficult in finding the exact contents you desire. This includes poor categorization and information tagging with terms that aren’t familiar to the general public. For first time business owners, finding a contract may be more of an arduous process than those who have experience. We hope to make that process much smoother and inviting.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <!--Samaya's Part-->
        <h3>1. Who are the users?</h3>
        <p>Our user base will broadly include any business owner hoping to sign onto a government work contract. Businesses which primarily participate in this labor contract model generally are small, American, locally-owned businesses. Also veteran-owned businesses make up many of the user base. While bigger companies will also occasionally pick up these contracts, we're mainly hoping to target and improve the experiences of small business owners who access this website. Veterans are a systemically underserved social minority. Also, bigger companies tend to have less ownership by racial, gender, and sexual minorities. Therefore an improvement of this interface would hopefully positively impact minority groups, as it'd make it easier for them to find lucrative government contracts.</p>

        <h3>2. What will the users do?</h3>
        <p>The users of the app will be able to create a profile for their business and provide detailed information about the services they offer. Once they add this information our app will generate relevant contracts using the information provided on their profiles. The app provides interactive features such as the ability to submit bids on contracts and powerful search filtering to make it easy for businesses to find what they are looking for. We’re following in the footsteps of apps like Handshake and LinkedIn where people upload their resumes and post their skillsets on their profiles.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Similarly, our application will allow clients to build customized profiles, showcase the type of work they do, and display their previous projects as a portfolio. Government agencies will also have the ability to search for companies and view their profiles.</li>
          <li>The bidding feature gives companies the ability to conveniently submit a bid proposal for a contract. Proposals are securely forwarded to the appropriate government agency or point of contact for evaluation. Clients can track the status of their contracts once they have submitted their proposals.</li>
          <li>The last feature is the filter on the search page that allows companies to narrow down specific types of contracts they’re looking for. The search page includes filters such as the location of the job, estimated duration of the contract, federal/state agency, and range of pay, allowing businesses to narrow down specific types of contracts they are interested in.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Amrith's Part -->
        <h3>3. What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
        <p>The aggregated data will be coming from mostly government websites where they display open contracts for businesses to bid on. We will then display these contracts for businesses to see on our website. Here are a few websites we may obtain data from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://apps.des.wa.gov/DESContracts/" target="_blank">Washington State Department of Enterprise Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://sam.gov/content/opportunities" target="_blank">System for Award Management</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://caleprocure.ca.gov/pages/Events-BS3/event-search.aspx" target="_blank">Cal eProcure</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Mike's Part -->
        <h3>4. How will the app help?</h3>
        <p>By addressing these issues, it will curate the current semantics and organization of government contract websites. Resources for businesses should be easy to find. While doing so, it will connect those with companies to create long lasting relationships for continued work while reducing missed connections. The search process would be easier especially for new business owners leaving “gate keeping” tactics at a minimum leveling out the playing field for those who are struggling.</p>
