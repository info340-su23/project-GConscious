          Overall, state government websites are notorious for being nearly
          indecipherable when trying to navigate their contents. As such,
          navigating through government platforms can prove to be difficult in
          finding the exact contents you desire. This includes poor
          categorization and information tagging with terms that aren’t familiar
          to the general public. For first time business owners, finding a
          contract may be more of an arduous process than those who have
          experience. We hope to make that process much smoother and inviting.

          By addressing these issues, it will curate the current semantics and
          organization of government contract websites. Resources for businesses
          should be easy to find. While doing so, it will connect those with
          companies to create long lasting relationships for continued work
          while reducing missed connections. The search process would be easier
          especially for new business owners leaving “gate keeping” tactics at a
          minimum leveling out the playing field for those who are struggling.
